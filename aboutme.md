subtitle: Elevator Pitch: Why Electronic Textiles?

I’m taking this course for two reasons. One of my good friends majoring in computer science once told me coding was like painting. That comment piqued my interest, and as an undeclared sophomore, I decided to try something new on the chance that it could be something I truly love. I’m also very interested in clothing design and want to improve my sewing skills, so this class seemed like a perfect fit.
