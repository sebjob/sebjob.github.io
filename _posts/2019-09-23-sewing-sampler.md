Completing this project was strangely fulfilling. Throughout the week, I'd find myself looking forward to the time when I could play some music or TV in the background and just sew for half an hour. One tip I would give myself (and anyone else who is planning on spending considerable time sewing) is to lick the thread when threading a needle. It makes the entire process far easier, and I would have saved plenty of time had I known this little trick when I began this assignment.
