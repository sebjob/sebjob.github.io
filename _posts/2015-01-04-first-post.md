My name is Sebastian Job. I’m a sophomore, currently undecided but leaning towards a degree in sociology. While I first began sewing as a sophomore, I never had any formal training and as a result only know the bare-bone basics. Still, I have enjoyed re-sewing deconstructed clothing for the past few years. I’m on the lookout for a sewing machine on campus, PLEASE let me know if you know of any. I had absolutely no programming experience until this summer, when I enrolled at the local community college and attended an introductory computer science class on Mathematica. In this class, I’m hoping to learn how to code/program, as well as develop my fundamental sewing skills. 

One boring fact about me:

When I was in middle school I accidently stabbed myself in the thumb with a metal ink pen, so now I have a little black dot on my thumb.
