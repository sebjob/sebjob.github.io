title: RGB Loop
---

For this assignment, I created a program that simulates a circuit that turns on different colored lights. With an int variable of runTime, our class was tasked with using while loops to create a program that prints out the colors of the lights every 10th runTime. There were three different (red, green, blue), that would repeat 3 times before the next set of colored lights would turn on. One tip I would give my past self would be to create a second variable that represents the number of times the program will run through the loop (derived from the runTime). This really helped me visualize the while loop process.
