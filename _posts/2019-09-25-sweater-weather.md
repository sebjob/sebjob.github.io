For this assignment I had to write a C-program that suggested clothing to wear based on a temperature. The program uses an integer variable "Temperature" that can be set to any number (fahrenheit). Depending on the temperature input the program will describe the appropriate clothing to wear. One tip I'd give past myself would be to pay close attention to the curly braces while coding with if/else if/else. That was the new small detail, similiar to semi-colons last week, that I had to pay particualr attention to.
