title: Final Project Proposal pt. 2

My final project will be a Santa Costume for my french Bulldog. The costume will display lights when a switched is turned on, and based off the temperature, will emit "Jingle Bells" from a buzzer. Below is a circuit diagram, as well as a sketch of the costume and a more in-depth description of the project
