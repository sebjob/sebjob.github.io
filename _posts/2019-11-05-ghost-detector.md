title: Ghost Detector
---

For this assignment, I had to create a program that would turn on all red lights on when a ghost was nearby. The program would know a ghost was nearby if the sensors detected that it was dark and cold enough. One hint I would've given myself would be too play around with the example code we were given to deduce the units and quanitity measured by the sensors.
