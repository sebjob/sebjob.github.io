title: Plushy Redux and Odd Menu Assignment
---

For this assignment, I had to construct my own "stuffed animal" with a circuit inside that could light up the toy's eyes and mouth. Using conductive thread, 3 LED lights, a button, and a switch I created a simple closed circuit, before using regular thread to sew up the "stuffed animal." The most difficult part of the process was using the conductive thread efficiently and effectively. The best advice I could give someone attempting this project would be to take their time and really map out exactly where you will be creating your circuit.
