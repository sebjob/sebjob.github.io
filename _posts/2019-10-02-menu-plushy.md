title: Plushy Redux and Odd Menu Assignment
---

For the plushy assignment, I had create c-program that served as a virtual model for the circuitry in the plushy doll I made. Using 0 and 1 for OFF and On, I used integer variables for a button and a switch to turn the lights are on or off. For the odd menu assigment, I created a c-program that had 10 different outputs (meal options), half of which could be selected from a secret menu. I used two integer variables; the first variable was used to assign if one could pick from the regular or secret menu, and the second was used determine which of meal one picked from the respective menu.
