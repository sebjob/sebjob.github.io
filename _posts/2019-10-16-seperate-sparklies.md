For this assignment, I had to create three different programs on Arduino. Each program had to light up different pins in a sequence. For instance, one program had the pin illuminated for half a second before turning off for four seconds. The program would then repeat itself. This assignemnt was the most difficult to date. It required a lot of researching and skimming resources for helpful code. I would suggest that anyone attempting this assignment to use Arduino's own guide for example coding. I spent far too long attempting to fix my third program, which involved fading lights. As soon as I looked indepth in Arduino's exmaple code I found code that was easily transformed into exactly what I had envisioned. Yet still, my code can be improved. In particular my second program, which involved a light flashing 3X seemed long. I know there must be shortcut for this code.
