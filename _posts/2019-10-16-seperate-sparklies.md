For this assignment, I created a circuit that could light up one LED light. However, this time I had to use conductive farbic and satin stiching to create two different switches, that when pressed, would close the circuit and allow the LED light to turn on. This project was quite tedious, and after completing it I was forced to restart because the circuit was not responding, and I could not conclude what the real issue was. The advice I would give would be to take your time with the sewing. Conductive thread is easily disrupted from the circuit, and the best way to ensure that nothing is wrong with your thread is to carefully sew it the first time.
