For this assignment, I had to create a program that would run a song through the arduino buzzer when a switch was turned on. I picked the song "Imperial March" from Star Wars. I would recommend finding simple code for a song. I originally wanted to do "Hedwig's Theme" from Harry Potter, but the code was incredibly complicated. I played around with it for an hour, optimistically (and naively) believing I could alter the code to turn it on in accordance to the switch. I ended up wasting time and getting nowhere. KEEP IT SIMPLE!
