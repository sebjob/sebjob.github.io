title: Final Project Complete! 
---

For this assignment i had to create a program that every second would turn on or off a random pwm pin on arduino board. If the light was off, it would turn on to a random brightness, while if it were on, it would turn off. The most difficult aspect of this project was understanding arrays. I had a friend go over arrays with me for an hour, and while I certainly learned a little bit more and it was great to be given a re-fresher, I still found it challenging wokring with arrays. My suggestion would be that it is essential to keep track of the state of the LED's by setting them to 0 if they are off and recording it, or setting them to thier given brightness and recording it. I did not do this intitally, and it makes it impossible to discern whether the program should turn off or on the random LED.
