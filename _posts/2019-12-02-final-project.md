PRESENTING: THE SANTA DOG COSTUME

For this assignment I created an interactive santa dog costume. I created a program that lit up LED's in sequence one after another when a switch is turned on. In addition, the program also plays jingle bells on a buzzer when a temperature sensor registers that the temperature outside is less than 40 F. However, my temperature sensor appears to be faulty, as when I was testing it out it recorded the weather as 60 F outside when it was near freezing temperatures. The costume itself was created bt making a cone (the santa hat), and then attaching a cutout face mask to the hat. Written on the hat is "Gas" standing for Gaston (sewn through backstitch), the dog who will be wearing this.I ended up doing a strange whip stitfch running along to the cutout, as it was slightly too big for Gaston, and I wanted the material to tighten aroun his face, as if there were eleastic around the edges. The hat contains all the ciricuitry, except for the LED's, which are placed on the bottom white band of the hat. Cotton balls would glued to the top of the hat and near the bottom of the cutout face portion of the costume to look like a big beard. In addition, there is a pouch that holds the external battery so the program can run on its own.

I wanted to do this project because I wanted my project to be useful. I knew that I would not truly wear any invention I created, because it could look a little tacky and definetly very strange with LED's and circuitry everywhere. I did not want my project to be something that is cool for day, before left somewhere to collect dust. I really wanted my project to be something I could return to every year (as long as it works). This is why I decided to have a project centered around my dog. My family love to dress up our little french bulldog (just for a minute or two to get some photos), and we already have several costumes for him. This should fit in seamless to ther rest of his little outfits, and its holiday themed! If we go christmas carolling, now Gaston can join along. It could even serve as an excellent Christmas or "gag" gift!

Materials List:
- conductive thread, brown thread
- needle, scissors
- 6 LED (2 red, 2 green, 2 white)
- Lilypad buzzer, switch, temperature sensor, arduino base, external battery
- cotton balls, fabric glue
- 12" x 12" red, tan, & white farbic

3 past tips to myself:

1. While I like the overall design of the costume, I wish I had reinforced the tan fabric that is used to line the perimeter of Gaston's face. While it probably is more comfortable with less material, it feels a little too weak for my liking. I would have loved to do this, however, I only last minute realized that this would be an awesome idea. I wish I had cut out two pieces of the tan fabric, rather than one. Sewing the two together would have made the costume truly sturdy. 

2. Circuitry is complicated. Take your time with it! I had to restart many times because I snapped my thread or got it stuck tied in a nasty knot. It's better to plan your thread placement ahead of time and taking the circuitry slowly, as restarting is quite frustrating and ultimately far more time consuming.

3. Sew the circuitry on prior to sewing on the lower half of the costume. I chose to finish all the regular sewing before commencing on the circuitry sewing. Because of the extra fabric and strange shape of the costume, the circuitry was harder to sew as I had to constantly adjust my head and the excess fabric.
