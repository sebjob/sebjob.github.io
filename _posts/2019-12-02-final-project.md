PRESENTING: THE SANTA DOG COSTUME

For this assignment i had to create a program that every second would turn on or off a random pwm pin on arduino board. If the light was off, it would turn on to a random brightness, while if it were on, it would turn off. The most difficult aspect of this project was understanding arrays. I had a friend go over arrays with me for an hour, and while I certainly learned a little bit more and it was great to be given a re-fresher, I still found it challenging wokring with arrays. My suggestion would be that it is essential to keep track of the state of the LED's by setting them to 0 if they are off and recording it, or setting them to thier given brightness and recording it. I did not do this intitally, and it makes it impossible to discern whether the program should turn off or on the random LED.

Materials List:
- conductive thread, brown thread
- needle, scissors
- 6 LED (2 red, 2 green, 2 white)
- Lilypad buzzer, switch, temperature sensor, arduino base, external battery
- cotton balls, fabric glue
- 12" x 12" red, tan, & white farbic

3 past tips to myself:

1. while I like the overall design of the costume, I wish I had reinforced the tan fabric that is used to line the perimeter of Gaston's face. While it probably is more comfortable with less material, it feels a little too weak for my liking. I would have loved to do this, however, I only last minute realized that this would be an awesome idea. I wish I had cut out two pieces of the tan fabric, rather than one. Sewing the two together would have made the costume truly sturdy. 

2. Circuitry is complicated. Take your time with it! I had to restart many times because I snapped my thread or got it stuck tied in a nasty knot. It's better to plan your thread placement ahead of time and taking the circuitry slowly, as restarting is quite frustrating and ultimately far more time consuming.

3. Sew the circuitry on prior to sewing on the lower half of the costume. I chose to finish all the regular sewing before commencing on the circuitry sewing. Because of the extra fabric and strange shape of the costume, the circuitry was harder to sew as I had to constantly adjust my head and the excess fabric.
