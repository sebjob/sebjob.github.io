For this assignment, I had to create one program that coudl make three different sets of LED lights turn on and off in 3 different patterns. This assignment was very similiar to the last assignment. While I completed the program, my lights do not all turn on at the same time from the start, as the the program should. For some reason, depending on the order of the sections of code that control their indepedent lights, controls which LED lights will turn on from the very start. I spent a lot of time rearranging my code, trying to fix this problem... but alas, could not. My advice would be to pay close attention to the properities of the blinking lights when writing new sections of code that should leave originial sections untouched.
